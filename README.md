# static_page_generator

This is a static page generator.

An example of a website generated by it can be found at jduarte.xyz.

I initially only wanted to create a simple website. Most of the tools I work with are overkill for a static website and I didn't feel like hand writing and copying HTML code a bunch of times.

I could technically learn how to use one of the many available static website generating tools, but I felt like the concept itself seemed simple enough that I might aswell do it myself.

So here it is. By this point, I can't even remember exactly what I wanted to create a website for, but whatever it might be, this tool aims to help me do that.

[UPDATE AUGUST 2022]

By this point, this is less of a generic static page generator and more of static picture gallery website generator. It is what it is.

## Functionality

The generator currently has two generating behaviours: text pages and image galleries.

Text pages are HTML pages converted from Markdown documents. These should be stored inside a directory which you can point to by changing the `PAGES_FOLDER` variable in the `.env` file.

Photo galleries are generated from photos containing keyword data. Each keyword will generate a section with the pictures which have that keyword placed within. The website's main page will display all photos. Point to your photos by changing the `PICTURES_FOLDER` directory in the `.env` file.

Running the docker container then sets up an nginx server with the pages you've just generated.

## Development

If you want to try this, I recommend setting up a virtual environment. For example:

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then running the `generator.py` script.

Eventually, I want this all to be done automatically when running the Docker container.

You can then run the container with:

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Et voil√†!

You should be able to access your new ~~empire~~ website at `localhost`.
